            Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language
            similar to PERL, that has gained popularity because of its clear
            syntax and readability. Python is said to be relatively easy to
            learn and portable, meaning its statements can be interpreted in a
            number of operating systems, including UNIX-based systems, Mac OS,
            MS-DOS, OS/2, and various versions of Microsoft Windows 98. Python
            was created by Guido van Rossum, a former resident of the
            Netherlands, whose favorite comedy group at the time was Monty
            Python's Flying Circus. The source code is freely available and open
            for modification and reuse. Python has a significant number of
            users.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A notable feature of Python is its indenting of source statements
              to make the code easier to read.

              Python offers dynamic data type, ready-made class, and interfaces
              to many system calls and libraries.
            </li>
            <li>It can be extended, using the C or C++ language.</li>

            This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts
            and features of the Python language and system

          <p>
            The Python interpreter is usually installed as
            /usr/local/bin/python3.7 on those machines where it is available;
            putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it
            possible to start it by typing the command:
          </p>
          <code> tag python3.7 </code>
          <p>
            On Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in
            C:\Python37, though you can change this when you’re running the
            installer. To add this directory to your path, you can type the
            following command into the command prompt in a DOS box:
          </p>
          <code>tag set path=%path%;C:\python37</code>

          <p>
            Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and
            wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an
            expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is
            straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most
            other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be
            used for grouping. For example:
          </p>
          <code
            >>>> 2 + 2 <br />
            4 <br />
            >>> 50 - 5*6 <br />
            20 <br />
            >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4 <br />
            5.0 <br />
            >>> 8 / 5 # division always returns a floating point number <br />
            1.6</code

        <article>
          <p>
            Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be
            expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes
            ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result [2]. \ can be
            used to escape quotes:
          </p>
          <code
            >>>> 'spam eggs' # single quotes <br />
            'spam eggs' <br />
            >>> 'doesn\'t' # use \' to escape the single quote... <br />
            "doesn't" <br />
            >>> "doesn't" # ...or use double quotes instead <br />
            "doesn't" <br />
            >>> '"Yes," they said.' <br />
            '"Yes," they said.' <br />
            >>> "\"Yes,\" they said." <br />
            '"Yes," they said.' <br />
            >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.' <br />
            '"Isn\'t," they said.'</code

            Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together
            other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written
            as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
            Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items
            all have the same type.

            >>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br />

          <p>
            The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used
            to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic
            progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the
            ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as
            C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence
            (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.
            For example (no pun intended):
          </p>

        <code
          >>>> # Measure some strings: <br />
          ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate'] <br />
          >>> for w in words: <br />
          ... print(w, len(w)) <br />
          ... <br />
          cat 3 <br />
          window 6 <br />
          defenestrate 12</code

            We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an
            arbitrary boundary:
          </p>
          <code
            >>>> def fib(n): # write Fibonacci series up to n <br />
            ... """Print a Fibonacci series up to n.""" <br />
            ... a, b = 0, 1 <br />
            ... while a < n: <br />
            ... print(a, end=' ') <br />
            ... a, b = b, a+b <br />
            ... print() <br />
            ... >>> # Now call the function we just defined: <br />
            ... fib(2000) <br />
            0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 <br />
          </code>

          <p>
            The keyword def introduces a function definition. It must be
            followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal
            parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start
            at the next line, and must be indented.

            This chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in
            more detail, and adds some new things as well. 5.1. More on Lists
            The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the
            methods of list objects: <br />

            <li style="list-style:none;"><code>list.append(x)</code> <br /></li>

            Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to
            <code>a[len(a):] = [x]</code> <br />

            <li style="list-style:none;"><code>list.extend(iterable)</code> <br /></li>

            Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable.
            Equivalent to <code>a[len(a):] = iterable</code> <br />

            <li style="list-style:none;"><code>list.insert(i, x)</code> <br /></li>

            Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index
            of the element before which to insert, so
            <code>a.insert(0, x)</code> inserts at the front of the list, and
            <code>a.insert(len(a), x)</code> is equivalent to
            <code>a.append(x)</code>.
